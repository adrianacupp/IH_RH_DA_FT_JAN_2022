# Activites List

Here are some of the tasks you need to perform:

### Activity 1 --- Done

- Aggregate data into one Data Frame using Pandas.
- Standardizing header names
- Deleting and rearranging columns – delete the column customer as it is only a unique identifier for each row of data
- Working with data types – Check the data types of all the columns and fix the incorrect ones (for ex. customer lifetime value and number of complaints )
- Filtering data and Correcting typos – Filter the data in state and gender column to standardize the texts in those columns
- Removing duplicates
- Replacing null values – Replace missing values with means of the column (for numerical columns)

### Activity 2 --- Done

- Bucketing the data - Write a function to replace column "State" to different zones. California as West Region, Oregon as North West, and Washington as East, and Arizona and Nevada as Central
- Standardizing the data – Use string functions to standardize the text data (lower case)

### Activity 3 --- Done

- Which columns are numerical?
- Which columns are categorical?
- Datetime format - Extract the months from the dataset and store in a separate column. Then filter the data to show only the information for the first quarter , ie. January, February and March. Hint: If data from March does not exist, consider only January and February.

### Activity 4 --- Done

- Show a plot of the total number of responses.
- Show a plot of the response rate by the sales channel.
- Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.
- Show a plot of the response rate by income.
- Don't limit your creativity!  plot any interesting findings/insights that describe some interesting facts about your data set and its variables.
- Plot the Correlation Heatmap.
- Clean your notebook and make it a readible and presentable with a good documentation that summarizes the Data Cleaning, Exploration(including plots) Steps that you have performed.

### Activity 5 --- Done

- Check the data types of the columns. Get the numeric data into dataframe called `numerical` and categorical columns in a dataframe called `categoricals`.
(You can use np.number and np.object to select the numerical data types and categorical data types respectively)
- Now we will try to check the normality of the numerical variables visually
  - Use seaborn library to construct distribution plots for the numerical variables
  - Use Matplotlib to construct histograms
  - Do the distributions for different numerical variables look like a normal distribution 
- For the numerical variables, check the multicollinearity between the features. Please note that we will use the column `total_claim_amount` later as the target variable. 
- Drop one of the two features that show a high correlation between them (greater than 0.9). Write code for both the correlation matrix and for seaborn heatmap. If there is no pair of features that have a high correlation, then do not drop any features

### Activity 6
- X-y split.
- Normalize (numerical).
- One Hot/Label Encoding (categorical).
