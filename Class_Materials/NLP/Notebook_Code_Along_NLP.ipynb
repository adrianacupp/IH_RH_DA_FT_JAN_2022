Easy, we can consider the independent features of our dataframe as one big feature: $X$ and the dependent feature ( rating ) as the other $R$. Then we want to compute what is the probability to obtain a given rating, given $X$. In other words, we are looking for $P(R|X)$. But now, we know the Bayes Theorem and we can compute this probability for every review as:\n",
